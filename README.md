 ## Description: 
Being a web developer means being part of a community. Here is my place to share my projects not only for applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that I can share my work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.

Always learning is the mantra I live by. 

## About Me
  <table>
  <tr>
  <td>
I am a thought leader in the space of consumer experience technologies and design. Over the past twenty  years, I've worked on a multitude of projects spanning numerous industries, leveraging my expertise in  consumer transaction technologies, sales, marketing, and user research. I excel in analyzing and  evaluating consumer engagements, executive communications, channel distribution optimization,  understanding and capitalizing on multi-industry megatrends, and transformational change management. 
Proficient in the MERN Stack; flexible, fast learner bringing curiosity and passion to every project. 
My teammates would describe me as energetic, articulate, and personable. I like to think that I bring a  confident demeanor to any situation and that I am able to seamlessly engage in a variety of realms. I have  a passion for marrying the humanities and technology and working towards delivering experiences that  are meaningful and personal. 
Away from professional life, I spend my time competing in professional gaming, drawing/graphic design,  teaching self-defense, and training police officers. It is important that I give back to the community, so the rest of my free time  is volunteered at non-profit associations and exploring new places.
